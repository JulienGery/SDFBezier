# Signed distance field with Bézier curves

Based on [Viktor Chlumský](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) Master's thesis.  
Use [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut).
## building and running
You'll need to have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) installed.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/JulienGery/SDFBezier`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `SDFBezier.sln` and hit F5 (preferably change configuration to Release or Dist first, Debug is slow)
